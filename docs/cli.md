# CLI

Statamic provides developers a nice long list of scripts available in the command line. They can clear caches, create users, generate addon and extension classes, and perform other time-saving tasks. In short, they make a developer's job easier and more enjoyable.

## Overview

Statamic's CLI commands are built with Laravel's Artisan Console package. To view the list of Statamic-specific commands, you may use the please list command:

```shell
php please list
